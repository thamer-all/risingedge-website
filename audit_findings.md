# RisingEdge Website Audit & Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Hero Section Spacing Issues

**Problem:** 
- Content was hidden under the navbar due to lack of proper spacing
- No padding between navbar and hero sections on all pages

**Solution:**
- Added `pt-20` class to the main element in App.jsx to create proper spacing between navbar and content
- This ensures all pages have consistent spacing and no content is hidden under the fixed navbar

```jsx
// App.jsx - Added padding-top to main element
<main className="pt-20">
  <Routes>
    ...
  </Routes>
</main>
```

### 2. Hero Section Background Consistency

**Problem:**
- Inconsistent hero section backgrounds across About subpages
- Some pages had gradients while others had plain backgrounds

**Solution:**
- Implemented consistent gradient backgrounds for all About subpages:
  - Mission page: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-600 via-purple-600 to-teal-600`
  - Team page: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-600 via-purple-600 to-teal-600`
  - History page: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-600 via-purple-600 to-teal-600`
- Added consistent overlay: `<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/20"></div>`

### 3. Invisible Testimonial Text

**Problem:**
- White text on white background in testimonials section making content invisible
- Poor contrast in testimonial cards

**Solution:**
- Fixed text colors in TestimonialsSection.jsx:
  - Main testimonial: Changed to `text-gray-700` on white background
  - Author name: Changed to `text-gray-900`
  - Role: Changed to `text-primary`
- Enhanced card styling with proper shadows and contrast

### 4. Animation Integration

**Problem:**
- Lack of smooth animations throughout the site
- Static content with no interactive elements

**Solution:**

  - TestimonialsSection.jsx: Added fade-in animations, transitions between testimonials
  - Mission.jsx, Team.jsx, History.jsx: Added scroll-triggered animations
- Implemented hover animations on interactive elements

### 5. Layout and Spacing Issues

- Poor visual hierarchy and readability

**Solution:**
- Standardized spacing across all pages:

  - Content sections: `py-20`
  - Container structure: `container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
